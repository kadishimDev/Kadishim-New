          KADISHIM - HOW TO RUN & DEPLOY
===================================================

This folder (START) contains the only scripts you need to run, manage, and deploy the website.

---------------------------------------------------
1. 🛠️ RUN LOCAL (Development)
---------------------------------------------------
Script: RUN_LOCAL.bat
Action: Starts the local development server (Vite).
URL:    http://localhost:5173
Use for: Coding, testing changes locally before deploying.

---------------------------------------------------
2. 🚀 DEPLOY SAFE (Production)
---------------------------------------------------
Script: DEPLOY_SAFE.bat
Action: 
    1. BACKUP: Downloads critical files from Production (uploads, config) to '_backups/'.
    2. SYNC: Fetches latest content (Memorials, Pages) from Production DB to local JSON (so you don't overwrite user edits).
    3. BUILD: Compiles the project (npm run build).
    4. UPLOAD: Uploads only CHANGED files to FTP, skipping protected files (uploads/, config.php).
URL:    https://kadishim.co.il
Use for: Updating the live site safely.

---------------------------------------------------
3. 💾 PUSH TO GIT (Source Control)
---------------------------------------------------
Script: PUSH_TO_GIT.bat
Action: Adds all changes, commits with a message, and pushes to GitHub.
URL:    https://github.com/Jacob/kadishim-new (Example)
Use for: Saving your code history to the cloud.

NOTES
===================================================
* Do NOT edit files directly on the server (FTP). Always edit locally and deploy.
* If you changed content (text/memorials) on the live site, run DEPLOY_SAFE.bat which effectively syncs it back to you before deploying.
* All logic scripts are located in the '../scripts/' folder if you need to modify behavior.
